For no forwarding:
Data Hazards (regarding dependencies) are done if the code is functionally identical to hw5
Will need to look at branch hazards if those are there (we don't know from pdf)

For Forwarding:
If there is a dependecy, we do not need to put any of the nops or * stuff, treat it as if there was no data hazard
We need to implement branch hazard for forwarding
